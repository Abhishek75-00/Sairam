//The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:
//Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class)

//. Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body.



//Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only 
//functionality to the user. Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides 
//the internal details, for example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message.
